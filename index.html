        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains the metadata for our web application.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a free, open-source version control system that allows web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work.</li>
          <li>It also allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code if a problem is discovered.</li>
          <li>GitHub is the largest provider of internet hosting for software and web development code, and provides the version control functionality of Git in a central repository.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work!</li>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
